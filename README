Project Status: NON-FUNCTIONAL / SUSPENDED
                Found a logic bomb in my original approach which, while
                helping to uncover a graph cycle in our schema which is
                the original culprit and inspiration for this project,
                ultimately will require more time to fix than I care to
                spend right now.

This project is to create an EntitySorter for Cayenne 3.1 that is free of
the Ashwood library and to replace Cayenne's AshwoodEntitySorter.  The
current library can, in certain circumstances, lead to "Can't extract a
master key" and "Cycles found" errors due to Ashwood not producing a
correct dependency graph or if someone overrides equals() on their 
DataObjects.
