Project Status: NON-FUNCTIONAL (in progress)

This project is to create an EntitySorter for Cayenne 3.1 that is free of
the Ashwood library and to replace Cayenne's AshwoodEntitySorter.  The
current library can, in certain circumstances, lead to "Can't extract a
master key" and "Cycles found" errors due to Ashwood not producing a
correct dependency graph or if someone overrides equals() on their 
DataObjects.
